## 1. How I Built the Project Step by Step

I started by creating a simple folder structure with three pages: `index.html` (Home), `about.html` (About/Services), and `contact.html` (Contact). To keep things easy, I linked Bootstrap 5 through a CDN so I didn’t need to install anything.

Next, I explored the Bootstrap documentation and examples. I picked out a few useful components like navbars, hero sections, cards, and forms. These became the building blocks of my website.

* On the **Home page**, I added a navbar, a welcoming hero section, a features section using cards, and a footer.
* On the **About page**, I used Bootstrap’s card layout to show the mission and vision.
* On the **Contact page**, I built a form with name, email, and message fields using Bootstrap’s form controls.

I mostly relied on Bootstrap’s utility classes for spacing, colors, and responsiveness, so I didn’t need to write custom CSS. Once everything looked consistent, I hosted the site on GitHub Pages and also tried out Netlify for deployment.

## 2. Resources I Used

* I checked the **official Bootstrap docs** a lot to understand the grid system and utility classes.
* For some parts, like the navbar and form, I borrowed snippets from Bootstrap examples but changed the content and structure to suit my project.

## 3. Challenges I Faced

One challenge was understanding how the grid system works, especially how layouts shift between desktop and mobile. I solved this by experimenting in the browser’s developer tools until I got the right look.

Another issue was making sure the navbar links worked properly across all pages. At first, a few links didn’t load, but I fixed it by checking the relative file paths carefully.

Deployment also took me a bit of time because I wasn’t familiar with GitHub Pages settings. After some trial and error, I figured out how to enable the main branch as the source and got the live link working.

## 4. My Learning Journey

This project was a really good hands-on introduction to Bootstrap 5. I learned how to build a responsive multi-page website without writing much custom CSS, and I got comfortable with Bootstrap’s grid, utilities, and components.

I also practiced version control with Git and GitHub, and learned how to host a website using GitHub Pages and Netlify. Overall, the process gave me confidence in setting up and finishing a small web project from start to finish.
